# caeplugin-Print3D
A Pointwise CAE plugin that exports a grid suitable for 3D printing.

![Print3D Wing Image][WingImage]

The exported grid is converted to a collection if inflated edges. That is, each unique grid edge is exported as a cylinder. The cylinders are saved to an STL file.

Several solver attribute configuration settings are available to control export behavior.

Due to the limitations of 3D printing, only coarse grids can be successfully printed.

For more information see [Printing Grids in 3D][Print3Dblog] at the Pointwise blog.
